# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Derivatives-Pricing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of Monte Carlo simulation techniques for pricing financial options. The project demonstrates how stochastic modeling and numerical simulation can be used to estimate the fair value of derivatives when analytical solutions (like Black-Scholes) are not easily applicable.

Monte Carlo methods are widely used in quantitative finance for modeling uncertain processes and estimating complex financial quantities.
This project focuses on applying Monte Carlo simulations to European-style option pricing, showing how repeated random sampling can approximate expected payoffs under different market scenarios.
